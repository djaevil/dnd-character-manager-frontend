# DnD Character manager - Frontend

This is the frontend for the DnD Character Manager, a web application that helps players create and manage their Dungeons & Dragons characters digitally. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use alternative to pen and paper, allowing users to register, log in, and customize their characters effortlessly.

Features:
- User registration and login  
- Create, edit, and manage DnD characters  
- Add custom notes and additional info fields  
- Responsive and user-friendly UI  

For the frontend to work and connect with the backend, an .env file needs to be created in the root directory with the following properties:
- "VITE_PORT", decides which port the frontend will be accessed through, ex. 3001
- "VITE_API_URL", the url of which the backend is hosted on
