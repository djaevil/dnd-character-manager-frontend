# DnD Character manager - Frontend

This is the frontend for the DnD Character Manager, a web application that helps players create and manage their Dungeons & Dragons characters digitally. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use alternative to pen and paper, allowing users to register, log in, and customize their characters effortlessly.

N.B.      
This project was created as part of my final code report for a Higher Vocational Education program and was put together in just one week. Its main purpose was to serve as a proof of concept. That said, I plan to continue developing and refining it further out of personal interest.

Features:
- User registration and login  
- Create, edit, and manage DnD characters  
- Add custom notes and additional info fields  
- Responsive and user-friendly UI  

.env file, setup:
- "VITE_PORT", decides which port the frontend will be accessed through, ex. 3001
- "VITE_API_URL", the url of which the backend is hosted on
